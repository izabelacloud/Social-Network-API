AS A social media startup<br />
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database<br />
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data<br />

GIVEN a social network API<br />
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application<br />
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database<br />
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts<br />
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON<br />
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core<br />
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database<br />
